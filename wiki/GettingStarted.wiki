=Getting Started with Freud=

Freud tests are built from an *iterator* of the content to test, and *assertions* on that content.
The results are returned via a *listener*.

For example.

Lets write a test to check that the length of a line in a text is not more than 80.

In Freud it will look like this:

{{{
Freud.iterateOver(TextLine.class).within(iterator).
                assertThat(lineLength().lessThanOrEqualTo(80));
}}}

We will iterate over TextLine objects and assert their length.

{{{
lineLength().lessThanOrEqualTo(80) 
}}}

is a hamcrest matcher which describes the assertion on the TextLine object.

The iterator implementation defines how to get the content (text in this case) and parse it into TextLine objects.
 
The iterator can be created in several ways depending on what the text content is and how can we access it.
