=Getting Started with Freud=

Every Freud test is built out of two components.

An [http://code.google.com/p/freud/source/browse/trunk/src/main/org/langera/freud/Analysis.java Analysis] object and an [http://code.google.com/p/freud/source/browse/trunk/src/main/org/langera/freud/util/collection/AnalysedObjectIterator.java AnalysedObjectIterator].

The Analysis object you select to use must match the type of input source you want to analyse.
For example, if we want to check wether a collection of java classes is a sub type of some class, 
ClassAnalysis is our best option, since it implements the [http://code.google.com/p/freud/source/browse/trunk/src/main/org/langera/freud/aclass/ClassDsl.java ClassDsl] interface.
This is a DSL with assertions about classes and unsurprisingly, it contains a method  

`BooleanOperatorDsl<ClassAnalysisBuilder> subTypeOf(Class type);` 

that we can use.

The iterator is the collection of classes to analyse.
This may be any implementation of [http://code.google.com/p/freud/source/browse/trunk/src/main/org/langera/freud/util/collection/AnalysedObjectIterator.java AnalysedObjectIterator] but the implementations that come with Freud should be good enough for most cases.
These can be iterators for a collection provided by the user or iterators based on file paths / classpath resources.
